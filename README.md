# Liri Bot
LIRI is smart search command line program that searches spotify, concerts and movie titles. It uses node.js and npm dotenv, moment, fs, axios, moment, and node-spotify-api to fetch queries to their api. It stores spotify key info in a .env file, and uses a gitignore to ignore node modules, .DS_Store, and .env files for data protection. Setup is a little tricky, steps outlined below.
